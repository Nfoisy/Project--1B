            <h2>We are Bellum.</h2>

            <p>We are Bellum.
                Bellum is an American metal band from New Orleans, Louisiana. 
                The band was formed by Vocalist David Koessl and guitar player Nick Foisy in 2021. 
                After sharing a passion for similar Nu-Metal bands such as Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Deftones, David and Nick started working together with metal vocals, rap, and heavy guitar riffs. 
                Later in 2021 they added lead guitarist Eduardo Giddins as a lead guitarist. Bands such as Municipal Waste and Behind Enemy Lines influenced his style of playing. 
                Andres Gonzalez joined the band as the drummer toward the end of 2021, giving the band a complete Nu Metal sound. 
                Bellum looks forward to touring throughout New Orleans and releasing its first EP around summertime.</p>
